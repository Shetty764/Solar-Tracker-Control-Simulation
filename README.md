# Solar-Tracker-Control-Simulation
## Description
This is a design and implementation of a controller to control the axis of a solar tracker system to optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight for maximum energy absorption. The foundational element for this project is the "Using the Worm and Gear Constraint Block - Solar Tracker" example from Simscape™ Multibody™. It is a simulation-based control system that manages the movement of at least one mechanical axis of a solar panel system, to track the sun's path across the sky accurately. The decision on which axis to prioritize and implement first in a solar tracking system is based on maximizing solar energy capture, which is influenced by the path of the sun relative to the location of the solar panels. For example, the sun's elevation in equatorial regions does not vary as much throughout the year, so a single-axis azimuth tracker might be sufficient. Conversely, in higher latitudes, the elevation axis might be more critical due to the significant variation in the sun's altitude with the seasons. Therefore, the design of the solar tracking system is tailored to the installation's specific geographic location and the solar panels' orientation. Here's a brief overview of the typical functions of each axis in a solar tracking system:

- Azimuth Axis: This axis allows the solar tracker to rotate horizontally. The movement along this axis aligns the solar panels with the sun's position from east to west throughout the day. Control of the azimuth axis is essential for following the sun's apparent motion across the sky, which is primarily due to the Earth's rotation.
- Elevation (Altitude) Axis: The elevation axis enables vertical movement of the solar panels. Adjustments along this axis change the tilt of the panels to match the sun's elevation in the sky, which varies with the time of day and seasons.
